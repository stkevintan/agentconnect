# AgentConnectOrg CRD + Operator

**Status:** Envelope, status, deletion, and rollout reconcile logic implemented — including the
drain handshake with the daemon and its timeout — plus the control-plane CR provisioner (§6);
gateway policy rendering waits on the gateway spike.

The managed execution plane provisions one _org envelope_ per organization on a
Kubernetes cluster: a namespace, RBAC, network policies, sandbox templates and
warm pools, and the org's daemon supervisor. This document describes the
declarative interface (`AgentConnectOrg`) and the operator that reconciles it.
The daemon-side half of the cluster story (spawn driver, shim, TokenReview
binding) is in [cluster-spawn-and-shim.md](cluster-spawn-and-shim.md); the
agent-sandbox stack it builds on is documented in `deploy/k8s/README.md`.

## 1. Shape of the system

- **`AgentConnectOrg`** (`agentconnect.md/v1alpha1`, namespaced, short name
  `acorg`) — one CR per org, living in the install's _control namespace_ (the
  Helm release namespace). The org's envelope namespace is **derived by default**
  — `<AC_ORG_NAMESPACE_PREFIX><CR name>` — and published on `status.namespace`.
  The CR is the sole desired-state carrier for the envelope; who
  writes it is deployment policy (an administrator or GitOps statically, a
  control plane programmatically), and the operator does not care.
- **Operator** (`@agentconnect.md/operator`, container bin
  `agentconnect-operator`) — two replicas, Lease leader election, the leader
  watches CRs _only in its own namespace_ and reconciles envelopes. It holds
  no control-plane credentials and has **zero Secret API access** anywhere.
- **Install-time constants** — each install is fully parameterized by its
  control namespace and an org-namespace prefix (`AC_ORG_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`).
  Several installs (environments) share one cluster by choosing disjoint
  constants; all isolation checks are static string comparisons rendered into
  each install's RBAC and admission policies at chart-install time.

## 2. CRD

Authoritative schema: `charts/operator/templates/crd.yaml` (full
openAPIV3Schema with per-field descriptions and CEL transition rules). The
zod schemas in `packages/operator/src/crd/types.ts` are the operator's runtime
guard; a parity unit test asserts the two field trees stay identical.

**The namespace is configurable at two levels** (`reconcile/namespace.ts` resolves
both, and every reader takes the resolved value):

1. _Install_ — `AC_ORG_NAMESPACE_PREFIX` fences every org namespace, always.
2. _Per org_ — `spec.targetNamespace` is an optional override. **Unset** (the
   normal path, and what the control plane always writes) derives
   `<prefix><CR name>`: the name is unique within the control namespace, so two
   CRs cannot collide on a namespace and none can name one outside its install —
   by construction rather than by validation. **Set** still has to start with the
   install's prefix, or the org lands `Degraded/NamespaceOutsidePrefix` with
   nothing written.

Either way the resolved name must be a DNS label: a CR name legal for a
Kubernetes object (a DNS _subdomain_) can still derive an illegal namespace, and
that lands `Degraded/InvalidNamespaceName` and writes no envelope objects. Two
orgs aimed at one namespace are caught by the claim label
(`Degraded/NamespaceClaimConflict`) — the operator degrades, never adopts.

| spec field                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `targetNamespace`             | Optional DNS-label override, **immutable** (CEL). Unset ⇒ derived `<prefix><CR name>`. Shape-only at CRD level; install ownership (prefix) is enforced by the operator and admission. |
| `suspend`                     | Quiesce the org: daemon to zero, sandboxes drained, gateway denies LLM calls.                                                                                                         |
| `daemon.image`, `daemon.tier` | Supervisor image (change ⇒ Recreate rollout) and resource tier name.                                                                                                                  |
| `daemon.credentialSecretName` | **Immutable**, default `ac-daemon-token`. A reference only — the Secret is written by the key authority, mounted required so the kubelet gates startup; the operator never reads it.  |
| `daemon.credentialRevision`   | Opaque; bumped after Secret rotation, projected into a pod-template annotation to force a Recreate.                                                                                   |
| `runtime.image`               | Sandbox image; change starts the drain-based rollout.                                                                                                                                 |
| `runtime.tiers[]`             | `{name, warmReplicas}` referencing cluster master template/pool pairs; 0 keeps a cold pool.                                                                                           |
| `quota`                       | `maxAgents`/`cpu`/`memory`/`storage`; zero values mean unlimited.                                                                                                                     |
| `llmLimits`                   | Per-session and per-org token/request rate bounds, rendered into egress-gateway policies.                                                                                             |
| `egressPolicy`                | `locked \| curated \| open` sandbox egress tier.                                                                                                                                      |
| `llmDeny`                     | Emergency LLM shutoff (`all` or per-agent).                                                                                                                                           |
| `deletionPolicy`              | `Delete` only in v1alpha1; `Archive` joins when its semantics exist.                                                                                                                  |

Status is operator-owned: `observedGeneration`, `namespace` (the resolved name,
published atomically with `NamespaceReady`, only after create-or-adopt plus label
validation — and the only place a consumer learns the namespace), conditions (`Ready`, `NamespaceReady`, `CredentialReady`,
`LimitsApplied`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`), daemon/sandboxes/pools summaries,
`appliedLimits` (an _observation record_ of the gateway policy API — possibly
`Unknown`, never an enforcement proof), and `rollout` progress.

Schema evolution: v1alpha1 with pruning; adding fields is free, changing
semantics requires a new version. The TypeScript choice should be revisited
only if CRD conversion webhooks become necessary.

| `reconcile/rollout.ts`        | The runtime-image rollout: conditioned image patch for Suspended instances, drain-requested handshake for Running ones, stale-request sweep, and the drain deadline that moves a stuck instance to `failed` (see below). | done          |
| `reconcile/gateway-limits.ts` | llmLimits/llmDeny → gateway policy kinds (pinned by the gateway spike).                                                                                                                                                  | **TODO stub** |

**Runtime-image rollout.** Changing `spec.runtime.image` rolls every bound Sandbox
onto it without ever killing a live turn, through a two-party handshake:

- A **Suspended** instance has no pod, so the operator patches its image directly.
  The patch is conditioned (`test` on `spec.operatingMode`) so a wake-up racing the
  swap rejects it and the next pass re-decides.
- A **Running** instance is _asked_ to drain: the operator writes
  `agentconnect.md/drain-requested: <rolloutId>/<image>` plus
  `agentconnect.md/drain-requested-at`. The owning daemon watches its namespace's
  Sandboxes ([`cluster-spawn-and-shim.md`](cluster-spawn-and-shim.md)), keeps new
  launches off a drained instance, and suspends it as soon as the work already on it
  ends — immediately when it is idle. The next pass then patches the image as above,
  and the pass after that sweeps both annotations once the instance runs the target.
  The operator never suspends a Running instance itself.
- An instance still Running `DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` after its request is reported in
  `status.rollout.failed`. It stays listed and nothing is re-requested for that
  target: a drain that has not landed by then will not land by being asked again. A
  new target image is a new `rolloutId`, which starts the handshake over. The bound
  is 30 minutes — an exported constant rather than a knob, set comfortably past the
  daemon's 15-minute idle host reclaim, which is what makes a quiet instance drain
  in the first place.

The request time lives on the object rather than in operator memory, so a leader
change does not restart every drain's clock.

Shared plumbing lives in `@agentconnect.md/k8s-client` (also used by the
daemon's K8sDriver): in-cluster config with per-request token re-read, bare
`node:http(s)` verbs, list-then-watch with resourceVersion resume and 410
re-list, and the Lease elector. No client-go-style dependency; reconciles read
live state (no informer cache, hence no cache-consistency window), and drift
in envelope objects converges via the bounded full resync (default 10 min)
plus the Deployment/Pod secondary watches that keep status conditions prompt.

## 4. Envelope inventory

Everything is stamped by server-side apply (field manager
`agentconnect-operator`, force) — one PATCH per object per pass, no read-back
diffing. Object names are fixed per-namespace constants (`ac-daemon`,
`ac-daemon-shim`, `ac-daemon-state`, `ac-runtime-<tier>`, `ac-quota`,
`ac-limits`); the namespace is per-org, so they never collide. Master
SandboxTemplates live in the control namespace as
`<AC_MASTER_TEMPLATE_PREFIX><tier>` (default `ac-runtime-<tier>`); daemon
resource tiers are a built-in small/medium/large table, unknown names falling
back to `small` with a warning. Order is policy-before-workload within one
reconcile pass:

1. `ensureNamespace` — resolve the namespace (§2), then create-or-adopt it via
   claim label; an out-of-prefix override, a name that is no DNS label, or a
   label mismatch ⇒ `Degraded`, never adopt.
2. `ensureServiceAccounts` — daemon SA; runtime SA with
   `automountServiceAccountToken: false` and zero bindings.
3. `ensureRoleAndBinding` — daemon SA: SandboxClaim CRUD + `Sandbox`
   get/watch/patch (admission restricts the patch to `spec.operatingMode`);
   no Secret verbs.
4. `ensureTokenReviewClusterRoleBinding` — per-org CRB to the install's
   release-prefixed tokenreview ClusterRole (TokenReview is cluster-scoped;
   a namespaced Role cannot grant it). No namespace ownerReference — the
   finalizer deletes it explicitly.
5. `ensureNetworkPolicies` — sandbox egress (gateway + git only) and daemon
   egress (control plane/relay/platform APIs + kube-apiserver + DNS).
6. `ensureQuotaAndLimitRange` — from `spec.quota`; omit when unlimited.
7. `ensureSandboxTemplates` — stamp per-org SandboxTemplate + one
   SandboxWarmPool per tier from the cluster master templates.
8. `ensureDaemonPvc` — ReadWriteOncePod (the Recreate strategy assumes
   single-attach).
9. `ensureDaemonDeployment` — strategy Recreate; required credential Secret
   volume (kubelet gates startup); `credentialRevision` annotation forces
   rotation rollouts. `CredentialReady` derives from pod state plus the pod's
   `FailedMount` events, which is where the kubelet — and only the kubelet —
   names a Secret it could not mount: a blocked mount reads
   `False/CredentialSecretMissing`, an unplaced pod
   `Unknown/DaemonPodUnschedulable`, any other stall `False/DaemonPodNotReady`.
   An Event is only believed while it is still being re-emitted and the pod is
   still awaiting container creation, so one retained past its fix cannot
   describe a mount that now works. Reading Events keeps the no-Secret-verbs
   boundary intact, and a forbidden events read only costs the nuance, never
   the status pass. An Event can also be written after the pod's last update,
   which no watch would wake the operator for, so the provisional verdict asks
   the queue for one follow-up pass a minute later rather than waiting for the
   full resync.
10. `ensureDaemonService` — ClusterIP for relay ingress and shim dial-in.

Deletion (finalizer `agentconnect.md/org-envelope`): quiesce → delete
workloads → (future: archive) → delete namespace + cluster-scoped bindings →
remove finalizer. Steps must be idempotent.

## 5. Chart (`charts/operator`, name `agentconnect-operator`)

One chart, one release per environment. `installCRD` gates the cluster-shared
pieces — the CRD plus the vendored agent-sandbox stack (`vendor/agent-sandbox.yaml`,
pinned to an upstream release manifest because upstream publishes no chart to a
registry). Every CRD is a _templated_ resource (conditional + upgradable)
carrying `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` so no release uninstall can
cascade-delete every org or every live Sandbox. The one thing the chart adds to
the vendored stack is the controller's label-domain allowlist, which replaces
rather than extends its default and without which every SandboxClaim is
rejected. Everything else is per-install: operator Deployment (2 replicas) +
SA/RBAC, the release-prefixed tokenreview ClusterRole, two
ValidatingAdmissionPolicies, and a pre-delete hook that refuses uninstall while
CRs remain — removing the operator would strand every finalizer. That hook is a
Job running the operator image's hidden `preflight-uninstall` subcommand under
the operator's own SA: it lists the CRs in the release namespace and exits
non-zero naming them, so the check runs the same client the controller does
instead of a second, drifting copy in shell. Publishing to the OCI registry
rides the release pipeline (not yet wired).

The policies are the static half of the isolation story RBAC cannot express —
RBAC grants verbs, admission bounds where they may be used — and each install
renders its own release-prefixed copies from its own constants (Kubernetes
≥ 1.30, both `failurePolicy: Fail`):

- **envelope fence** — every write by the install's operator SA must target a
  namespace carrying its prefix, its own control-namespace CRs and Lease being
  the only exceptions; namespaces it stamps must carry the org/claim labels and
  a `baseline`-or-stricter Pod Security level; the per-org TokenReview binding
  is the only other cluster-scoped object it may write. A control namespace
  marked `agentconnect.md/control-namespace` is never a write target, and the
  marked namespace object itself can be neither deleted nor unmarked — that pair
  is what protects a _neighbouring_ install from a prefix misconfigured to
  overlap it. The Namespace object needs its own check because it is
  cluster-scoped: no `namespaceObject`, and an empty `request.namespace`.
- **sandbox baseline** — pods in an org namespace (claim label, narrowed to the
  install's prefix) may not be privileged, share host namespaces, or mount
  `hostPath`; every pod but the daemon supervisor must set
  `automountServiceAccountToken: false`, and the audience-scoped projected token
  the shim handshake needs is the only service-account token it may carry.
  Pods are the enforcement point, so a sandbox created from an operator-copied
  template is covered without teaching the policy about its controller.

## 6. Control-plane provisioner

The CR writer is control-plane code (`packages/control-plane/src/cluster/`),
opt-in through `CLUSTER_EXECUTION_MODE` (`off` | `in-cluster` | `kubeconfig`);
off is the default and mounts nothing. It is deliberately the SAME path for a
self-hosted cluster install and a hosted deployment — only the policy inputs
differ (`CLUSTER_ORG_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`, which must equal the operator install's
`AC_ORG_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`, plus the default images and tier).

- `org_cluster_execution` (one row per org) holds only the spec fields the
  control plane owns. Status is never mirrored there: the console reads it live
  off the CR, so a row can never disagree with the cluster.
- `resourceName` — the CR's name — is derived once as the org id folded to a DNS
  label, truncated so the operator's `<prefix><CR name>` still fits in 63
  characters, and stored: it is the handle every later call addresses the
  envelope by. The control plane never writes `spec.targetNamespace`, so the
  namespace is the operator's to derive; anything that needs it (the credential
  Secret write) reads `status.namespace` off the CR. Server-side apply only
  prunes fields this manager owns, so an override written by hand survives.
- Writes are server-side apply under field manager
  `agentconnect-control-plane`, so the operator's own manager is untouched;
  the control plane never writes `/status`, finalizers, or envelope objects.
- `PUT /orgs/:orgId/cluster-execution` (owner-only) persists then applies;
  `enabled: false` deletes the CR and hands the envelope to the finalizer, while
  `suspend` quiesces without tearing down. `GET …/cluster-execution/status`
  projects the operator's conditions and summaries.
- Every write bumps `specRevision`, and a write applies the CURRENT row and
  then re-reads that revision: two concurrent writers would otherwise be able to
  leave the row at one spec and the CR at an older one forever, since the
  operator reconciles the CR and nothing here re-reads on a timer.
- Deleting an organization records its envelope in `pending_envelope_teardown`
  **inside the delete transaction**, because the cascade removes the only copy
  of its `resourceName` and after that nothing could name the resource, namespace
  and workloads the operator is still keeping alive. Reading the row
  there is also what serializes the boundary: an enable that committed first is
  visible, and one that has not is blocked by the org row's `FOR UPDATE` and
  then fails its foreign key. The delete route retires the CR immediately, and a
  five-minute drain covers an unreachable cluster or a process that had cluster
  execution switched off at delete time. The one window the tombstone cannot
  cover — a `PUT` whose apply is in flight while the delete commits — closes in
  the convergence loop: a settings row that vanished between apply and re-read
  means the org is gone, so the request deletes what it just created.

### The key authority

The same module writes the credential Secret, which is what makes "the operator
has zero Secret verbs" workable: the operator only NAMES the Secret in
`spec.daemon.credentialSecretName` and mounts it required, so the kubelet gates
the daemon pod's startup on a credential the operator can never read.

`POST /orgs/:orgId/cluster-execution/credential` (owner-only) mints the org's
daemon API key, publishes it as the Secret's `config.json` entry — the same
`{version, daemonId, controlPlane:{enabled,url,key}}` document a hand-run daemon
reads, pointed at the same WebSocket URL onboarding renders — and bumps
`credentialRevision`, which the operator projects into a pod-template annotation
to force a Recreate. **The key is never returned**; it exists only inside the
cluster Secret, and the response carries the daemon id, Secret name, and
revision.

Daemon keys never expire, so the design is mostly about what happens when a
step fails. A credential is only issued while the envelope is ENABLED — a
disabled one is being torn down, and publishing into its dying namespace would
undo the retirement disable just performed. Beyond that, three mechanisms:

- **A fencing token, not just a lease.** A transition claims
  `credentialRotationAt` + `credentialRotationToken`, and every subsequent write
  — staging, committing, retiring, and the release itself — carries that token
  **in its `where` clause**, not in a preceding check: a check-then-write pair
  leaves a window a takeover can land in, which Prisma's default isolation would
  not close. The timestamp only decides when a takeover is allowed; the token is
  what stops an expired holder from committing behind its successor or unlocking
  it, and `commitCredential` additionally requires `enabled: true` so no
  rotation can land a live key on an envelope disable already retired. A
  takeover deliberately does NOT touch whatever the dead holder left in
  `credentialStagedApiKeyId` — that key may already be published, so it stays
  the pod's working credential until a later publish has definitely replaced it.
- **A sequence for the cluster, since the token cannot reach it.** A database
  token cannot fence a request already in flight to the API server, so
  `credentialRotationSeq` — monotonic per claim — is stamped on the Secret as
  `agentconnect.md/credential-seq`, publishing is a `resourceVersion`-guarded
  read-modify-write, and a publish carrying a lower sequence than the one
  already there refuses rather than overwrites. Otherwise a request that stalled
  past its lease could land after its successor's and restore a key the row no
  longer names.
- **Staged before published.** The minted key is recorded before the Secret is
  written, so every failure point after that leaves a durable handle rather than
  a live key nobody can name.
- **Queued before attempted.** Revocations go into
  `pending_daemon_key_revocation` before they are tried and are cleared only
  once they land; promoting a key and queueing the one it supersedes happen in
  ONE transaction, because a stop in between would overwrite the only handle to
  the predecessor. The maintenance loop retries whatever is still owed.
- **Named before revocable.** Naming a key is not permission to kill it. A key
  that MAY be in use — the one a successor displaces out of the staged slot, one
  whose publish landed but whose commit lost the claim, or the predecessor a
  commit supersedes — is queued `held`: durable, listed by nothing, drained by
  nothing. Only a key that definitely never reached the cluster is revoked on
  the spot.
- **Committed is not rolled out.** `commitCredential` bumping `specRevision` is
  durable INTENT; the pod keeps running on its old key until the CR itself
  carries the new `credentialRevision`. So the commit also records
  `credentialRolloutPending`, and the held keys are released only by
  `completeCredentialRollout` — after the apply has actually succeeded. A
  request that dies in between leaves both the obligation and a working
  credential; `drainCredentialRollouts` finishes it under the same per-org claim
  and releases then, so the retry is durable rather than dependent on the caller
  coming back. That retry re-applies through the CONVERGENCE loop, not a bare
  apply: a settings write needs no credential claim, so one can land while the
  drain's apply is in flight, and a stale apply would revert the CR while the
  drain closed the only record that anything was owed. Retiring the envelope
  drops the obligation and releases the keys, since a pod that is going away has
  no credential left to strand.

Disabling takes the same claim BEFORE it writes anything, and the write that
clears `enabled` is the same transaction that drops the credential, queues both
its keys, and records the resource for teardown — so there is no moment where
the row reads disabled but its credential was never retired, and a delete that
fails leaves state that converges rather than an `enabled: false` row beside a
live pod holding a live key. Re-enabling takes the same claim while it cancels
the tombstone AND applies the resource, and the teardown drain takes it per org
before deleting — otherwise a drain that had already listed that tombstone could
delete the resource the re-enable just created.

Four orderings carry the rest:

- **Secret before revision.** A failed write leaves the running pod on its old,
  still-valid key instead of rolling it onto a credential that was never
  published. The namespace not existing yet — or `status.namespace` not being
  published yet, which is read BEFORE the key is minted — is the ordinary "just
  enabled" state and answers 409 rather than recording anything.
- **Identity before publication.** A first issue records the provisioned
  `credentialDaemonId` before anything can fail, and revokes its own key if
  publication does — so a retry re-keys that daemon instead of provisioning
  another one and leaking the first key.
- **Revoke last, and only when definitely unpublished.** The superseded key dies
  only after the rollout has been asked for, so there is no window in which no
  valid key exists. And a publish that THREW is settled by re-reading the
  Secret's sequence before anything is revoked: a write whose response was lost
  to a dropped connection still landed, and revoking that key would leave the
  pod mounting a dead credential. An unverifiable failure is treated as "may
  have landed" — keeping a key alive one rotation too long is far cheaper than
  killing a live one.
- **One daemon identity.** The row pins `credentialDaemonId`, so a rotation
  re-keys the org rather than orphaning its sessions, agents, and history under a
  new daemon row. Switching cluster execution off revokes the key and clears the
  credential; the daemon row itself stays, since removing one is the Daemons
  page's job (it unplaces agents and repoints collaboration routes).

The control plane's ServiceAccount therefore needs `get`, `create`, `update`,
and `delete` on `secrets` in the org namespaces this install owns — `get` and
`update` because publishing is a `resourceVersion`-guarded read-modify-write,
not a blind apply. That is a deployment-side grant, and the only Secret
permission anywhere in this system.

## 7. Verification

Unit tests run against an in-process fake API server
(`@agentconnect.md/k8s-client/testing`) — no cluster needed. The CRD parity
test fails when the YAML and zod field trees drift. `helm lint
charts/operator` is part of the check ritual until charts get their own CI.
